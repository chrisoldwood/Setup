Setup v1.1
==========

1) Manual.

Setup.exe requires a config file called setup.ini, which must live in the same
folder as the executable and any files you are installing. An example one is
provided, which has comments to tell you what to set.

Also included is a new tool called MkSetup.exe which is a GUI tool for generating
a setup.ini file. 

It has no Uninstall support at present.
