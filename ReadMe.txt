Setup v1.2
==========

Introduction
------------

This is a very simple installer that creates an installation folder, copies the
files into it and also optionally creates any shortcuts in the Start Menu and on
the desktop.

Releases
--------

Stable releases are formally packaged and made available from my Win32 tools page:
http://www.chrisoldwood.com/win32.htm

The latest code is available from my GitHub repo:
https://github.com/chrisoldwood/Setup

Installation
------------

Run setup.exe.

or

Copy all the files in the archive to a folder.

Uninstallation
--------------

Delete all the files from the archive.

Documentation
-------------

Setup.exe requires a script file called setup.ini, which must reside in the same
folder as the executable and any files you are installing. An example one is
provided, which has comments to tell you what to set. Alternatively, you can use
my GUI tool called MkSetup.exe to generate the script.

NB: It has no Uninstall support at present.
